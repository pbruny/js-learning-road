# Eloquent JavaScript exercises

The exercises you'll find here is from the [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/ "Eloquent JavaScript") book.  
The files' name is a reference to the chapter and the number of the exercise in the book.  
In the files, I put my own comments about my thoughts to solve the exercise. If there is no comments in the file, I've considered the exercise simple and solve in the first attempt.
